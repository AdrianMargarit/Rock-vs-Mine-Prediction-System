# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-System
This is a small personal project which I have made in order to practice my Machine Learning skills. In this project I am using Logistic Regression to create, train and test a model that will predict, based on a dataset and on input, if an object detected by the sonar of a submarine is a rock or a mine.
